@unnumbered Precautions

@enumerate
@item
We use password (passphrase) authentication, so overall security fully
depends on its strength. So you should use long, high-entropy
passphrases. Also remember to keep passphrase on temporary file and read
it securely as described in @ref{Verifier}.

@item
You must @strong{never} use one key for multiple clients.
If so, then all security is ruined and transmitted data can
be decrypted.

@item
You must use @strong{cryptographically good} pseudo random number
generator. By default we use default @code{crypto/rand} library that
reads @code{/dev/urandom} source. Some GNU/Linux and FreeBSD systems
are rather good with this entropy source. Closed proprietary ones are
always not and you must use optional @ref{EGD} feature with them.
