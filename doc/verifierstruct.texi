@section Verifier structure

Verifier is a derivative of the password. It is resistant to
dictionary attacks and can not be used for authentication (only
its verifying).

@verbatim
SOURCE = PBKDF2(SALT=PeerId, PASSWORD, 1<<16, SHA512)
PUB, PRIV = Ed25519.Generate(SOURCE)
@end verbatim

Verifier is public key of Ed25519 generated from the PBKDF2 of the
passphrase in hexadecimal encoding. @code{PeerId} is used as a 128-bit
salt. Server stores and knows only verifier. Client can compute the
whole keypair every time he makes handshake.
