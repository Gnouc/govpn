@node Client part
@section Client part

Except for common @code{-mtu}, @code{-noncediff}, @code{-timeout},
@code{-stats}, @code{-noise} options client has the following ones:

@table @code
@item -remote
Address (@code{host:port} format) of remote server we need to connect to.
@item -iface
TAP interface name.
@item -id
Our client's identification (hexadecimal string).
@item -key
Path to the file with the PSK key.
@item -up
Optional path to script that will be executed after connection is
established. Interface name will be given to it as a first argument.
@item -down
Same as @code{-up} above, but it is executed when connection is lost,
when we exit.
@end table

Example up-script that calls DHCP client and IPv6 advertisement
solicitation:

@example
client% cat > up.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
dhclient $1
rtsol $1
EOF
client% chmod +x up.sh
@end example
