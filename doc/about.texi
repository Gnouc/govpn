@item
Fast strong @ref{PAKE, passphrase authenticated} augmented
@ref{Handshake, key agreement protocol} with zero-knowledge mutual peers
authentication (PAKE DH A-EKE (Diffie-Hellman Augmented Encrypted Key
Exchange)).
@item
@ref{Verifier structure, Augmented authentication tokens} resistant to
offline dictionary attacks. An attacker can not masquerade a client
even with server passphrase verifiers compromising.
@item
Encrypted and authenticated @ref{Transport, payload transport}
with 128-bit @ref{Developer, security margin} state-of-the-art
cryptography.
@item
Censorship resistant handshake and transport messages: fully
indistinguishable from the noise with optionally hidden packets lengths.
@item
@url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy, Perfect forward secrecy}
property.
@item
Replay attack protection (using one-time MACs).
@item
Built-in rehandshake (session key rotation) and heartbeat features.
@item
Ability to hide packets length with the @ref{Noise, noise} data.
@item
Ability to hide payload timestamps with @ref{CPR, constant packet rate}
traffic.
@item
Compatible with @url{http://egd.sourceforge.net/, EGD} (entropy
gathering daemon) PRNGs.
@item
Several simultaneous clients support with per-client configuration
options. Clients have pre-established @ref{Identity, identity} invisible
for third-parties (they are anonymous).
@item
Uses @url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAP_(network_driver), TAP}
underlying network interfaces.
@item
Can use @ref{Network, UDP and TCP} or HTTP @ref{Proxy, proxies}
for accessing the server.
@item
Fully IPv4 and IPv6 compatible.
@item
Optional built-in HTTP-server for retrieving real-time
@ref{Stats, statistics} information about known connected peers in
@url{http://json.org/, JSON} format.
@item
Written on @url{http://golang.org/, Go} programming language with
simple code that can be read and reviewed.
