@subsection Network transport

You can use either UDP or TCP underlying network transport protocols.

TCP is more resource hungry. Moreover because of packet loss and TCP
reliability it can lead to "meltdown" effect: significant performance
loss of underlying TCP connections. Generally TCP is not advisable for
VPNs, but it can help with some nasty firewalls.
