@section Noise

So-called noise is used to hide underlying payload packets lengths.
Without it GoVPN provides confidentiality and authenticity of messages,
but not their timestamps of appearance and sizes.

You may turn on @code{-noise} option, that forces to fill up all
outgoing packets to their maximum (MTU) size. As it can be applied only
to outgoing traffic, you should enable it on both sides in most cases.

Pay attention that this can dramatically increase your traffic! It is
turned off by default.
